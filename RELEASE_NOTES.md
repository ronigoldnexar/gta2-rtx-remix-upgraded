# GTA2 RTX Upgraded 1.2

A Direct3D 9 renderer for GTA2 that lets RTX Remix path-trace the game, built on
[gebdag/gta2-rtx-remix](https://github.com/gebdag/gta2-rtx-remix) (MIT). This release adds a hand-made visual layer on top.

## Install

1. **Install RTX Remix:** download `Remix_Plus_v1.5.1_x86_games_release.zip` from the **Assets** list at the bottom of the
   [Remix Plus 1.5.1 release page](https://github.com/RemixProjGroup/dxvk-remix/releases/tag/remix-plus-1.5.1) and unzip it into your
   GTA2 folder next to `gta2.exe`. (Without it the game runs, but without ray tracing.)
2. **Unzip this release** into the same GTA2 folder. Say yes to replacing files.
3. **Start the game.** **F4** (or the game's own **Options** button) opens the settings panel.

The zip contains no game files, no RTX Remix binaries and no player profiles, and installing it never touches your saves.
The mod can autosave after a big payout; to turn that off, untick **Save after a big payout** in the F4 menu and click Save,
or add `[save]` and `auto_save=0` to `gta2dx9_settings.ini`.

## Where to get GTA2

GTA2 was officially free for a while: Rockstar gave it away as part of its **Rockstar Classics** series, together with the first
GTA and Wild Metal Country. That free offer has ended. Rockstar later sold it on its own store (until 2013, according to
[Delisted Games](https://delistedgames.com/?p=10001)), and Steam removed its GTA2 page in July 2025 without explanation.

So today there is no official place to get it. The game is still easy to find online if you look for it (searching for
"GTA 2 Rockstar Classics" is a good start), but those copies come from third parties, so use one you trust, or a copy you
already own (the original CD, or an old Rockstar or Steam purchase). This project ships no game files and does not host or
link to downloads of the game.

## What's new in 1.3

- **Third person and first person views.** Press **V** in game to cycle GTA2's own top-down view, a chase
  camera behind you (on foot or at the wheel, mouse orbit, stops short of walls) and a view from your own
  eyes or the driving seat (mouse look, your own body and car left out of the picture). Pedestrians are
  stood up as figures facing the camera so they can be seen from a low angle. The key, distances, heights,
  fields of view and mouse settings are on the new **Camera** tab of the F4 menu; `mode=` and `toggle_key=`
  under `[camera]` in `gta2dx9.ini` set the view a level starts in and the key.
- While a chase or first-person view is up, the window the game populates with cars and pedestrians is
  widened (Camera tab, *Game's view, scaled*), since those views see past the window GTA2's own camera frames.
- **Linux.** The source now builds with GCC (MinGW-w64) as well as Visual C++: `make` on Linux produces both
  DLLs, `make check` loads them under Wine and resolves every export, and `linux/install.sh` / `linux/run.sh`
  set up and start the game in a Wine prefix (optionally with DXVK). See `linux/README.md`, including what RTX
  Remix does and does not do under Wine.
- The two DLLs are built on GitHub Actions with the MSVC x86 toolset on every push (`.github/workflows/build.yml`),
  and the build's `gta2dx9-x86` artifact is exactly the set of files a player drops into the GTA2 folder.

## What was new in 1.2

- **Smoother on a fresh install:** the first time a car model or a new paint colour appears, the mod used to stop the game for a
  moment to build its HD glass maps, door pictures and dents. That work now runs in the background, so new cars and doors no
  longer cause stalls. The first run on a new PC still has to build its cache, but it no longer freezes the game while doing so.
- **Fixed:** the Rednecks emblem now appears only on the dark-blue Rednecks pickup, on its cab roof, not on every pickup in
  stage 2.

## What was new in 1.1

- **Fixed:** the car radio no longer goes silent when you drive away from its source. It now stays in stereo and fades out
  with distance, as intended.
- **Safer exit helper:** the small helper that closes a game that hangs on exit now runs Windows' own `cmd.exe`, `ping.exe` and
  `taskkill.exe` by their full system paths, so a look-alike file in the game folder can never be run instead.
- **Autosave documented:** the README now explains the autosave after big payouts and how to turn it off.

## What's in it

- Hand-made HD cars with full PBR maps (albedo, normal, roughness, metal) and real glass
- Doors and dents drawn as shading on the HD cars; wheels, roof domes, gang roof logos
- Taxi, police and emergency lights; blood puddles on the road
- Radio stays in stereo at any distance (original distance effect is a menu option)
- Voice packs for gangs, cops and pedestrians
- Emissive maps and animated water as Remix mods

## Known issues

- Tank turret still uses the game's original low-resolution art and looks out of place next to the HD hull.
- 5-star FBI cars show blue instead of black.
- Some cars still have unmarked windows or false glass; a few sprites (pink sports car, limo) are still low-res.
- Daytime light trails (denoiser), pedestrian flicker and dusk reflections need more work.
