// *black* on its way out to the cutout edge, and those black texels are opaque:
// alpha 255, colour (8,0,0). That is the black rim, and it is why bleeding the
// transparent texels never touched these sprites - the black is in the visible
// part of the picture, not behind the alpha.
//
// Art like that only makes sense drawn additively, where black adds nothing.
// GTA2's own renderers never blended at all (d3ddll.dll sets no blend state; the
// 3dfx one draws colour-keyed), so on a 1999 CRT the rim was simply accepted.
// Under a path tracer an opaque black surface is as black as black gets and it
// reads as a hole punched round the fireball.
//
// Which sprites those are is decided from the artwork rather than from a list:
// a black outline is a thing no ordinary cutout sprite has. Measured over a
// capture of the shipped districts, the fire and explosion frames come out at
// edge median luminance ~5, while the darkest sprite that is not an effect - a
// pedestrian in shadow - sits at 23. The default falls in that gap.
//
// This deliberately does *not* also require a bright core. It used to, and that
// was wrong: an explosion's last frames are embers and smoke, dark all over, and
// the core test threw exactly those out - so the animation went from a glow to
// an opaque black blob on its final frame, which is worse than never having
// fixed it. A dying fire is still a fire, and additively it fades to nothing,
// which is what it should do.
