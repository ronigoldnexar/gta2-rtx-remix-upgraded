// World-space geometry recovered from the game's own draw calls.
//
// GTA2 hands the renderer screen-space vertices, but it does not throw the
// world-space ones away: every vertex it projects also has its **absolute**
// world position written four slots further along the same array, by
// FUN_0046bbf0 for map faces and FUN_004b9990 for sprites. FUN_0046bbf0 adds
// the camera position back in before storing, so these are absolute map
// coordinates, not camera-relative ones.
//
// That makes it possible to place sprites and the odd block shapes as real 3D
// geometry without ever inverting a projection: the numbers here are the input
// to the game's transform, not the output.
//
// Used for sprites - cars, pedestrians, powerups - which are rebuilt each frame
// so they can move. Map geometry is deliberately *not* sourced this way: the
// game only draws what is currently visible, so anything built from its stream
// would pop into existence as the camera reached it.

// --- Why each sprite is its own draw call ---------------------------------

// Because RTX Remix has to recognise a sprite as the same sprite it saw last
// frame, and it can only do that from what the draw call looks like.
//
// This pass used to hand Remix, once per texture, a bag of world-space vertices
// for every sprite sharing that texture, drawn with an identity world matrix.
// Reading dxvk-remix, that is close to the worst thing to give it:
//
//   * DrawCallCache buckets geometry by its *topological* hash, and
//     hashGeometryDescriptor (rtx_hashing.cpp) mixes in the **vertex count**. A
//     batch grows and shrinks as cars and pedestrians come into view, so its
//     bucket key changed constantly and every such frame allocated a fresh
//     BlasEntry with no history at all.
//
//   * Previous-frame vertex positions only exist when the *same* BlasEntry is
//     matched again (SceneManager::processGeometryInfo keeps them in
//     historyBuffer on kUpdateBVH). Inside a batch, vertex i belongs to whichever
//     sprite the game happened to submit i'th that frame. Two cars swapping draw
//     order silently repointed every vertex at a different object, so the
//     previous positions Remix did have described the wrong sprite - a motion
//     vector from one car to another. That is the flickering copies.
//
//   * With an identity world matrix, InstanceManager::updateInstance sees
//     hasTransformChanged == false; with no usable history hasPreviousPositions
//     is false too, and surface.isStatic is then set, which tells the renderer to
//     skip motion vector calculation for a surface that is visibly moving.
//
// So the geometry has to be the thing that stays still and the transform the
// thing that moves - which is what every other game gives Remix. Each sprite is
// now one draw call of a canonical quad in its own object space, quantised so it
// is bit-identical frame to frame, with the placement in D3DTS_WORLD. Remix then
// matches it by topological hash plus proximity (DrawCallTracker's spatial map)
// and takes the motion straight from objectToWorld against prevObjectToWorld.
//
// The cost is one draw call per sprite instead of per texture - a few hundred
// two-triangle draws, which is nothing for either D3D9 or Remix, and it lets
// every sprite of a kind share one BLAS instead of rebuilding a merged one.
