# Playing Downtown in the street-level views (7 Nov 2026)

The mission runner (`gamerun/mission_play_wil.py` on `gamerun/mission_lib.py`,
mirrored in `linux/docker/`) plays GTA2's Downtown missions from the decompiled
plans (`assets-src/missions/missions.json`) and the renderer's log, in third
person on foot with first-person stretches at the start of every walk and at
the wheel of every drive. Every run is on the L4 GPU image (`run_game_gpu.sh`,
30 fps capture), 20 minutes per run (`SECS=1200`), one fresh game per run.

What changed in the runner for this pass (v2 in `mission_lib.py`):

- **Router**: Dijkstra over (x, y, level) instead of BFS at one level. Slopes
  (stairs, ramps, the phone daises) join one lid level to the next along their
  own axis only (GTA2's `up/down/left/right` slope types name the uphill
  direction on screen; checked on the Yakuza phone dais, where types 3-4 rise
  toward the south). Pavement costs 1, grass 1.4, road 3, so the walker keeps
  off the carriageway where it can.
- **Walker** (`cruise_to`, `walk3`): Up held, heading corrected from the
  half-second samples, instead of stop-turn-step. A 150-cell leg now takes
  about 80 s (it took 5 min before).
- **Driver** (`drive3`): Up held with proportional steering, speed cap, brake
  before corners, back out of stalls, re-route; `slow` mode for missions.
- **Precision**: `nudge_to`/`settle` step onto a point with 8 cm pulses and
  watch the game's message buffer, because `LOCATE_*` boxes are 0.4-0.5 block.
- **Which job started**: two phones stand side by side at every gang site; the
  title message the game shows (`msg` = 1954 RADIO ZA-ZA!, 1955 PIZZA CAKE!
  ...) selects the plan, and the gang's refusals (1097/1103/...) are recognised.

## Runs

| run | missions | result | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `out/pt_wil1` | tutorial, GET ZITZAKI | tutorial: all four gang-zone phones reached (briefs 1619, 1622, 1624 in order), the last 0.5-block box at the spawn missed by 0.3 block; GET ZITZAKI: walker could not climb the phone dais (slopes were routed sideways) | `out/pt_wil1_sheet.png` (phone, Messer, three zone phones), run killed before the video closed |
| `out/pt_wil2` | tutorial, GET ZITZAKI | tutorial again to the last box (not triggered: the box is on the stair foot at the spawn); the Yakuza phone **was climbed** via the dais slope with the directional router, but the Yakuza refused the job ("do not do business with Zaibatsu whores", 1097) because the tutorial thread was still running | `out/pt_wil2/game.mp4` (20 min), `m_*.png` |
| `out/pt_wil3` | GET ZITZAKI, RADIO ZA-ZA (fresh game, no tutorial) | **GET ZITZAKI started** (title + brief 1631), the marked Miura entered (model 37, brief 1636), driven to the hospital box (brief 1638 "sound the horn"), but the driver backed out of the box while un-stalling and horned 3 blocks away ("Get back there and sound the horn!", 1648); the doctor never boarded; at the Funabashi garage the damaged car caught fire: **JOB FAILED** ("I should have guessed you would wreck the car"), the player died in it. Then the Loony phone pair: the walker's nudges answered the neighbouring phone, **PIZZA CAKE! started**; the runner followed the RADIO ZA-ZA plan instead and the second phone said "are you not already on a Loony job" (1103) | `out/pt_wil3_sheet.png`, `out/pt_wil3/game.mp4` (20 min, 0 faults) |
