# Actions in the street-level views (7 Nov 2026)

What the game does, how the renderer learns of it, and how it is drawn in third
and first person. "Verified" means seen in a frame of a scripted run on the L4
build; "mechanism" means the code path exists but the game state that triggers
it was not reached in a run. The classic top-down view is untouched by all of it.

| action | the game's signal | drawn as | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| walk, run, idle | ped position per frame, frames 0-15 | Rocketbox clips, stride-matched, smoothed heading | verified (earlier passes) |
| punch | frames 115-130, state 7 sub 0xe | `punch` clip, one-shot, re-triggered per swing | verified (earlier passes) |
| knocked down, get up, dead | corpse flag, state 8/9 | `fall` held lying, played back out on recovery | verified (earlier passes) |
| get in / out of a car | frames 16-35, state 3/4 | Rocketbox crouch in/out | verified for NPCs; the player's own climb untested |
| aim / fire, one-handed | frames 36-47 in state 7 (not fists) | `aim` clip + the pistol pickup model in the right hand | mechanism; see the run notes below |
| aim / fire, two-handed | frames 48-52, state 7 or 0 | new `aim_heavy` clip + the machine-gun pickup model in the hand | mechanism; see the run notes below |
| muzzle flash, sparks | base-4 effect sprites the game lays flat | stood up to face the camera, centred at gun height (0.30 block) | see the run notes below |
| bullets in flight | small effect sprites that moved since last frame | a streak from the previous to the current position, a hand wide, facing the eye | see the run notes below |
| fire, explosions, smoke | base-4 effect sprites | the existing flame stacks; every large effect quad now stands up facing the camera on the spot it lay | mechanism (no explosion in this pass's runs; earlier respawn runs had flat ones) |
| swimming | state 8 sub 0x14, frames 131-135 | new `swim` clip (front crawl, prone), figure sunk 0.14 block | mechanism (no water reached) |
| hands up / arrested | frames unknown (`g_pedHandsUpFrames` -1) | `handsup` clip exists, disabled until the frames are measured | open: no arrest provoked by any script yet |
| burning | corpse/fall + the game's fire sprites | fall clip, fire sprites now upright | mechanism |
| headlamps, tail lamps | `[renderer] car_lamps`: dark = the sky's sun below 6 deg; 2 = always | additive radial glows at the body's ends (3D models and sprite-built bodies alike), none on wrecks | see the run notes below |
| brake lamps | the body's own speed frame to frame: a car losing > 1.5 blocks/s^2 | the tail glows flare red and grow while braking, day or night | see the run notes below |
| helicopter rotors | object animation `rotor` (base 4 frame 0) | a synthetic spin clip on the `rotor_5` node (mast, 7 rev/s) and `tailrotor_7` (hub) | mechanism: no helicopter appeared in the runs |
| car doors opening | the sprite's door artwork | not mirrored on the 3D body (the models have no door panels) | open |
| car damage, dents | only the player's `cardmg` is read | the game's own damage smoke, now upright; no dents | open |
| trains, buses, tank, bank van | ordinary vehicles | their models (bus and bank van seen driving in QA2 / the master demo) | trains and tank not seen in a frame |
| horn, phone pose, pickup flash, score popups | HUD / sound | left to the game | n/a |

## Run notes

Scenario `gamerun/actions3d.py` (`qa_run.sh actions3d`, GPU image, `car_lamps=2`,
`GTA2DX9_LOG_PED_FRAMES=1`): the player is warped to the COLLECT_02 machine-gun pickup in the
walled Downtown park (154.5,129.5), fires bursts in third and first person with 4 fps frame
strips, then stands at the carriageway kerb (164.5,147.6) and photographs passing cars within
three blocks. Runs `out/qa_actions3d` (full), `out/qa_actions3d_b` (bursts only, final build);
0 faults, 0 locator losses. Sheet: `out/actions3d_sheet.png`.

Verified in frames:
- Bullets in flight as streaks ahead of the player in third person and across the park in first
  person; muzzle/impact flashes stood upright at gun height beside the player and on the fence
  (before this pass the same artwork lay flat on the grass as a sliver).
- A pedestrian hit by the burst goes down with the fall clip (`qa_c_fire_third2_01`).
- Headlamps: white glows at the nose of a passing sedan and of oncoming traffic at a distance;
  tail lamps red at a van's rear in first person (`car_lamps=2`). Brake flare: the mechanism
  runs on every car (speed loss > 1.5 blocks/s^2) but a braking car was not caught in a frame.
- The two-handed stance clip (`aim_heavy`) triggered on an NPC on frames 48 (log), not seen
  in a frame.

What the runs showed about the game, and what is still open:
- The machine gun is fired on frames 53-60 in state 7 sub 0xe, the same frames and words as the
  fists-ready stance, so the frames alone cannot tell shooting from boxing. The renderer now
  treats a figure in that stance as shooting when a tiny sprite (a flash, a bullet, a spark) was
  drawn within a block of him in the previous frame, and holds the `aim` clip and the weapon for
  1.5 s after. With the pickup's five rounds the shooting lasts about a second and the aim
  triggered once (log `action 2`, player object) but no frame caught the raised arm or the
  pistol model in the hand: unverified. A weapon with more ammunition (the respawn scripts
  found none reachable) or NPC gunfire (police) is the way to verify it.
- Which weapon a figure holds is not known to the renderer (no weapon field in the ped struct
  has been found; the HUD only shows the player's): the one-handed stance draws the pistol
  pickup model, the two-handed stance the machine gun.
- Impact flashes on a wall appear near the top of the wall rather than at the bullet's height
  in some frames (`qa_c_fire_third2_*`): the lay height of those sprites may be the shooter's
  level, so the +0.30 lift over-shoots at a lower wall base. To check with a level camera.
- The tracer is the game's bullet sprite stretched between its last two positions (capped at
  half a block); in first person a fast bullet can read as a short arc.
